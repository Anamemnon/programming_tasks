64. Minimum Path Sum

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers,
find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12
